# Mine Sweeper
## The Traditional Old Fashioned Game
In this classic game of Mine Sweeper, you are presented with a 10 x 10 board. Some squares contain hidden mines, and others dont. 

Click on a square! If you haven't clicked on a bomb then you'll be given a number.  That number represents how many bombs may appear in the 8 adjacent squares around it. If you think you know the location of a bomb, then RIGHT CLICK and place a flag.  If you locate all the bombs (without setting them off)... YOU WIN!
